      <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        Completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science has been both a challenging and rewarding experience, culminating in my capstone 
        project and the development of this ePortfolio. Throughout the program, I have improved my technical abilities while enhancing professional 
        skills that are important to todayâ€™s technology driven workplace. From mastering data structures and algorithms to building a full-stack web 
        application, each course has helped me improve my foundation in computer science and prepared me to contribute effectively to professional 
        environments.
        <br>
        <br>
        Working on collaborative projects has been valuable in developing my approach to teamwork and communication. In group assignments, I learned how 
        to coordinate with my peers, manage project timelines, and communicate technical concepts clearly to technical and non-technical audiences. These 
        experiences improved how I take complex technical solutions and turn them into actionable recommendations, which is an essential skill for both 
        software development and IT roles. My coursework in software engineering, database management, and software security has given me practical experience 
        in designing, implementing, and securing systems.
        <br>
        <br>
        The artifacts in this ePortfolio represent a range of my competencies and achievements in computer science. The Software Design and Engineering artifact,
        the Grocer Inventory project, demonstrates my skills in software design, object-oriented programming, and application development. The Algorithms and Data
        Structures artifact, the Course Planner project, shows my ability to implement efficient algorithms, manage complex data structures, and optimize problem 
        solving solutions. Finally, the Databases artifact, the Contact Service application, shows my proficiency in database design, integration, and management 
        using MySQL, including secure and efficient data handling. These artifacts provide a solid representation of my technical competencies, analytical thinking 
        and readiness to contribute effectively to professional computer science roles.
